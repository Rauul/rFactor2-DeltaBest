Status:      Working, possibly with bugs. Not that many anymore.

== What is this? ==

This is a proof of concept plugin for a Delta Best or Delta Split, or
whatever you want to call it.

The idea is not new at all. At least iRacing has something like this,
and I haven't seen it done yet for rF2.
Maybe TrackMap plugin has this, but I don't use TrackMap,
so I don't know.

== Proof! ==

The idea is that you are shown in realtime the difference (split)
between the current lap and your best lap of the current session.

== Status ==

Currently it works decently. Due to the way scoring updates work
in rF2 (every 0.2s) is not super accurate, but I tried to do some
interpolation of speed and position values, so it should be
already quite accurate.

== Customizing plugin position and appearance ==

You can customise how the time appears on screen by creating
an INI file. The INI file must be called "DeltaBest.ini"
and must be placed in the same Plugins folder as the "DeltaBest.dll"
file itself.

An example of INI file that you can change at will is bundled
in this zip file as "DeltaBest.example.ini". If you want to customise
the plugin, copy that file in "DeltaBest.ini" and change at will.

== For feedback ==

Feedback on bugs, feature requests, generous donations :)
etc... are appreciated:
