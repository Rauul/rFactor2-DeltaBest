Status:      Working, possibly with bugs. Not that many anymore.

This is a proof of concept plugin for a Delta Best or Delta Split, or
whatever you want to call it.

The idea is not new at all. At least iRacing has something like this,
and I haven't seen it done yet for rF2.
Maybe TrackMap plugin has this, but I don't use TrackMap,
so I don't know.

Screenshot or it didn't happen:

The idea is that you are shown in realtime the difference (split)
between the current lap and your best lap of the current session.

Currently it works decently. Due to the way scoring updates work
in rF2 (every 0.2s) is not super accurate, but I tried to do some
interpolation of speed and position values, so it should be
already quite accurate.

Feedback on bugs, feature requests, etc.. is appreciated:
